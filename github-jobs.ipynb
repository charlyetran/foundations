That&#39;s why we will host a unique event on 16th (evening), 17th and 18st of March 2017: the ASML PhD Master Class.</p>\\n\\n<p>During the PhD Master Class, we will be showcasing some of the fascinating and extreme technology challenges that we are currently facing. You will experience our way of doing things and get a strong impression of the ASML culture.</p>\\n\\n<p>For three days, we invite you to use your &quot;brilliant mind&quot; in a team-based workshop aimed at cracking those challenges. We will also be setting up personal exploration interviews to get you acquainted with ASML and you will meet peers from all over the world.</p>\\n\\n<p>For this event, we are looking for PhD students in the last phase of study, or those with a maximum of two years of experience in the working field related to:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>(Applied) Physics / Astronomy</li>\\n<li>Computer Science / Embedded Systems / Artificial Intelligence / Data Science / Information Technology / Computational Science / Software Engineering</li>\\n<li>(Applied) Mathematics</li>\\n<li>(Physical) Chemistry / Chemical Engineering</li>\\n<li>Material Sciences</li>\\n<li>Mechanical Engineering</li>\\n<li>Mechatronics / Systems &amp; Control</li>\\n<li>Electrical Engineering</li>\\n<li>Aerospace Engineering</li>\\n<li>Nanotechnology / Nanoscience / Nanomaterials</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><b>A great opportunity for a brilliant mind</b><br>\\nOne of the reasons why ASML has already attracted some of the world&#39;s best minds is the very nature of what we do; the ICs that we help to make impact on every level of society. You could say that we help to make healthcare systems more affordable for example or transport systems greener and more energy-efficient. You could also say that we make education more accessible to everyone. We make these things happen because microchips are at the heart of all electronic things, and we create the machines that not only help making microchips, but our creative technology continues to make them smaller, faster and cheaper. And having an impact on almost every aspect of modern human life is a challenge that talented people seem to rise up to with enthusiasm.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>This is more than just a career opportunity; it&#39;s a chance to make a real difference.</b><br>\\nHendrik Hans (26) from Medan (Indonesia): &quot;My ideas about ASML changed totally. I was amazed about the nanotechnology that is involved in the production of chips. Without ever smaller components, we would still be walking around with cell phones in size shoebox.&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Selection process</b><br>\\nUnfortunately we are limited in the number of participants for the PhD Master Class. Therefore we will review your registration according to the following process:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Application deadline January 10th 12:00PM. Applications should include a resume with contact information, GPA&#39;s and publications (optional in scientific appendix).</li>\\n<li>First selection round: we will inform you about the outcome of the CV review January 20th.</li>\\n<li>If you are through to the second round, we will ask you to record a video motivation as a preparation for the next selection round (technical matching board).Deadline for recording is January 27th.</li>\\n<li>Second selection round: your resume and motivation video will be reviewed by a technical matching board.
